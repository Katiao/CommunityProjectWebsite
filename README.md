# CommunityProjectWebsite
A portfolio template website built using HTML, CSS / Sass and Vanilla JavaScript

Live site: https://vigilant-neumann-1308c7.netlify.app/

Went from a markup design to building a website using semantic
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without using any Frameworks.
Used CSS Grid, Flexbox and Media Queries to make website fully
responsive.
Wrote JavaScript to add behavior, user events and modify the DOM.
Utilized Sass to keep CSS code organised.
Created a REST API using Strapi and retrieved data from API in order
to display blog content dynamically.
